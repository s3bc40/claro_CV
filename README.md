# Curriculum Vitae G.Claro Sebastien

## About
Hi guys ! I'm Sebastien , a student from the university of Bordeaux, and currently studying Bioinformatics. I'm just posting my CV here to be able to enhance it and make it available for everyone.

I'm still learning the web languages such as HTML/CSS and JavaScript, and the librairie like jQuery and the framwork Bootstrap. :)

I want to thank the [website w3School](https://www.w3schools.com/) for all the tutorials and templates, that permit to achieve my CV. :D 

CV is still in french for the V1 but I intend to traduce it on english later.
